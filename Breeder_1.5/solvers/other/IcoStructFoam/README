Description
===========
A mix of icoFoam and solidDisplacementFoam that adds implements 
an interaction between a fluid and a solid

Only as a demonstration of the explicit coupling between two different
solvers across a boundary

Required OpenFOAM-Version (Known to work with)
==============================================
1.5
Unchanged to the 1.4.1-version, so it should work with that
(a version for 1.3 can be download from the Wiki-page)
Propably won't compile with 1.4

==================
icoStructFoam    : the solver itself
icoStructFoamTest: A simple channel that is deformed by the pressure of 
		   the fluid
thingOnStick     : A deformable solid is fixed on an undeformable solid 
		   and deformed by the passing fluid
runAnIcoStructCase.sh: Small shell-script that prepares and runs an example
		       case using the PyFoam-Utilities
