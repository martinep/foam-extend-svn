Warning #1: Make sure your OpenFOAM environment is properly initialized before
            running the test harness.

Warning #2: It is recommended to use cmake version 2.8.0 or newer for
            running the test harness.


1: Instructions for starting a local test harness on your machine:
------------------------------------------------------------------

a) You can set your local system identifier using the environment variable
   $CDASH_SUBMIT_LOCAL_HOST_ID.  Please try using a unique identifier like
   your machine's hostname. Otherwise, the fully qualified name of your system 
   will be used.


b) Install the CMakeLists.txt and CTestConfig.cmake files by executing the following commands:

cp ./CMakeFiles/CMakeLists.txt $WM_PROJECT_DIR
cp ./CMakeFiles/CTestConfig.cmake.openfoam-extend $WM_PROJECT_DIR/CTestConfig.cmake


c) Run the test harness and push your results on the CDash server on openfoam-extend

cd ./runDir; ./Allrun_Experimental
  or
cd ./runDir; ./Allrun_Nightly


2: Instructions for restarting your setup from scratch:
-------------------------------------------------------
cd ./runDir; ./Allclean


3: About submitting your results
--------------------------------

Both Allrun_Experimental and Allrun_Nightly scripts will submit their results
to the CDash server of your choice, as specified by the file
$WM_PROJECT_DIR/CTestConfig.cmake. 

To submit your results to the CDash server on openfoam-extend, just use
the file CTestConfig.cmake.openfoam-extend. 

If submitted to the CDash server on openfoam-extend, your results will be displayed here:
http://openfoam-extend.sourceforge.net/CDash/index.php?project=OpenFOAM-1.5-dev
