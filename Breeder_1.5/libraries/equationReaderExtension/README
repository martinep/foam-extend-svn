Description
===========
An extension to OpenFOAM that allows you to read equations from a dictionary
file and (optionally) have them evaluated at every time step.  It is a user-
installed modification to OpenFOAM's core library.

Installation/Compilation
========================

equationReader must be installed into OpenFOAM's core library.  Since it is
still in beta, you have to do this manually.  You only have to edit one file.  To install equationReader, refer to the instructions on the wiki, as they are most up to date.

Contents
========

 - The source code for the library, which should end up in:
        src/OpenFOAM/db/dictionary/equation
 - A modified version of Scalar.C, which should end up in:
        src/OpenFOAM/primitives/Scalar
 - A demo application (equationReaderDemo) that demonstrates the basic use of
   equationReader.  After installation, this should end up in:
        applications/test/equationReader/equationReaderDemo
 - A test application (equationReaderTester) that puts the equationReader
   through a series of tests with an integrated solver.  This should end up in:
        applications/test/equationReader/equationReaderTester
 - Tutorial directories for both of these applications.  These should end up
   in:
        tutorials/equationReader/

Required OpenFOAM-Version (Known to work with)
==============================================
1.5
1.5-dev
1.6

History
=======

 2010-07-21: Initial import
 2010-08-05: Differentiated versions for OpenFOAM 1.5.x/1.5-dev and OpenFOAM 1.6+
 2010-08-12:
    * Added IOobject support for automatic output - IOEquationReader
    * Removed need for pointers
    * Added support for scalarLists as a data source
    * Cleaned up available functions
 2010-10-16:
    * Added full support for fields - equationReader can now operate across the
        entire mesh.
    * Bug fixes:
        * Dimension-checking for min and max functions
        * Moved IOobjects to db directory
