Reading testDict dictionary

Begin stand-alone operation...
Reading a scalar... done.  Result = 1.94281
Reading a dimensionedScalar ... done.  Result = standAloneDScalar [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0.080125

Creating the equationReader object

Creating data sources: dictionary ptrs... scalars... dimensionedScalar ptrs... output dimensionedScalar ptrs... done.
Linking in the data sources: dictionary ptrs... dimensionedScalar ptrs... scalar ptrs... done.

Reading equation a from testDict with no output variable
Evaluating equation a ... done.  Result = a [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0.625

Reading equation b from testDict, linking an output variable
Output variable before update() = activeOutB [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0
Begining .update() - this evaluates all equations with active output...
Done.  Output variable after update() = activeOutB [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0.3235

Equation c depends on equation a.  Reading it will link them.
Reading equation c from testDict... done.
Evaluating c will force an evaluate of a.
Evaluating ... done.  Result = c [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0.805821

Equation d depends on equation e, but equation e is never explicitly 
read by equationReaderDemo.  Reading equation d will automatically 
create equation e on-the-fly. 
Reading equation d from testDict ... done.
Again, evaluating d will force an evaluate of e.
Evaluating d ... done.  The result is = d [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] 2.04124

Equations can draw from any sources added to equationReader.
Equation f is very complex, drawing from numerous sources.
Reading equation f ... done.  Evaluating equation f ... done.
The result is: f [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] -86.1698
