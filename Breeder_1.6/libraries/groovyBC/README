Installation/Compilation
========================

The library can be compiled with "wmake libso". It doesn't have to be
installed in a specific location but has to be added to the libs in 
controlDict

Contents
========

 - The actual source code for the library
 - A folder "Demos" with four demo cases. All of these cases only require
   a blockMesh. The solvers to be used are
   - pulsedPitzDaily: pisoFoam
   - wobbler: solidDisplacementFoam
   - circulatingSplash: interDyMFoam (this one crashes halfway through the calculation)
   - movingConeDistorted: pimpleDyMFoam
   - average-t-junction: pimpleFoam

Required OpenFOAM-Version (Known to work with)
==============================================
1.5
1.5-dev
1.6

History
=======

 2009-03-15: Modified so that it compiles on 1.5-dev
 2009-08-04: "Ported" to 1.6 (only the Demos had to be adapted)
