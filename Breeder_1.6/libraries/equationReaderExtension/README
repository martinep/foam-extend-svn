Description
===========
An extension to OpenFOAM that allows you to read equations from a dictionary
file and (optionally) have them evaluated at every time step.  It is a user-
installed modification to OpenFOAM's core library.

History
=======

 2010-07-21: Initial import
 2010-08-05: Differentiated versions for OpenFOAM 1.5.x/1.5-dev and OpenFOAM 1.6+
 2010-08-12:
    * Added IOobject support for automatic output - IOEquationReader
    * Removed need for pointers
    * Added support for scalarLists as a data source
    * Cleaned up available functions
 2010-10-16:
    * Added full support for fields - equationReader can now operate across the
        entire mesh.
    * Bug fixes:
        * Dimension-checking for min and max functions
        * Moved IOobjects to db directory
 2011-04-06:
    * Major efficiency improvement - pointer functions have been implemented to increase computation speed by an order of magnitude (at least).
    * Improved dimension-checking on all functions.
    * Added a fieldEvaluate function for active equations whose output is to a scalar field.
    * Bug fix to get it working with 1.6-ext and higher.
 2011-09-13:
    * Major upgrade:
        * Now a stand-alone library.
        * Now works with most generic types:
            * scalar;
            * vector;
            * tensor;
            * diagTensor;
            * symmTensor; and
            * sphericalTensor.
        * Now works with GeometricFields
        * Dimension checking is now performed separately, improving efficiency of field and GeometricField calculations.
    * Interface changes:
        * Add data functions reorganized / changed.
        * Evaluate functions reorganized / changed.
        * Update functions removed.
 2011-09-25: Version 0.5.0
    * Improved treatment of fields - now approximately 10x faster.
    * Introduced version numbers to keep track of changes.
