Description
===========
A variation of icoFoam that adds (very simple) Lagrange-particles
Only as a demonstration that shows how to add particles to existing 
solvers

Documentation
=============
See: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_icoLagrangianFoam

Required OpenFOAM-Version (Known to work with)
==============================================
1.4 
(a version for 1.3 can be download from the Wiki-page)

Directory Contents
==================
icoLagrangianFoam: the solver itself
cavityLagrange:    driven cavity with particles
ejectorLagrange:   a box. particles are ejected upward. Some leave the box, some do 
		   not. Fluid has no motion but picks up momentum from the particles

Known Bugs
==========
The ejector-case doesn't seem to work right when particles start bouncing on the floor
(propably because of the difference in subtimestep-calculation between 1.3 to 1.4)
