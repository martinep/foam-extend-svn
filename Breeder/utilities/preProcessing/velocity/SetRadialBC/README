Documentation
=============
In the dictionary rotationDict the following things have to be specified:
 - a list of patches
 - a rotation vector
 - a rotation speed
Using these the velocities on the specified patches are set for the first 
time-step (assuming that theses patches have the appropriate type)

The dictionary rotationDict is also used by makeAxialMesh
