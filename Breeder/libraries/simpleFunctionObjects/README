Installation/Compilation
========================

This library needs source-files that belong to the OpenFOAM-installation.
To install them in such a way that they can be compiled by users without 
write-access to the OpenFOAM-installation do the following:

- Go to the directory with the sources of the library (with "cd")
- Call the scriptfile that copies external dependencies:
	./prepareForCompilation.sh

Now the library can be compiled with "wmake libso". The above steps only 
have to be executed once

Required OpenFOAM-Version (Known to work with)
==============================================
1.4.1
