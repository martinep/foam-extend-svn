To compile the rotorStatorInterfaces library one has to use either the 
1.4.1-dev or the 1.4.1 with linking additionally the GGIinterpolation files 
from the development version.

Compiling with 1.4.1
the following folder has to be copied into the rotorStatorInterfaces directory
./src/OpenFOAM/interpolations/GGIinterpolation/

into the Make/files the following entry must be added :
GGIinterpolation = GGIinterpolation
$(GGIinterpolation)/GGIinterpolationName.C

To the Make/options the following entry to the include path must be added :
-I./GGIinterpolation 


Thats it type wmake libso at the rotorStatorInterfaces directory level and 
the libRotorStatorInterfaces.so should be compiled.
how to use it is described in the corresponding tutorial.
